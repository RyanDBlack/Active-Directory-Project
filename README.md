# Active-Directory-Project
An Active Directory environment, along with a Splunk instance, has been set up to simulate brute force attacks using Kali Linux

## Objective

This Active Directory Project aims to establish a monitored active directory environment for simulating domain users within and sending out brute force attacks toward them. The primary focus was to send out an attack once information was "compromised" and then use the telemetry that was returned to figure out where exactly was being targeted due to irregular behavior and patterns to mimic a real-world attack/breach. This hands-on experience was created to deepen the understanding of active directory, brute force attacks, and virtual machines.
